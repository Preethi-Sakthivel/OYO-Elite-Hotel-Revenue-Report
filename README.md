Project Overview

Title: Hotel Revenue Performance Analysis & Dashboard Development Using Power BI

üìÖPurpose and Business Problem:

The project aimed to solve the challenge of fragmented revenue and occupancy data across multiple hotels by building a unified, interactive Power BI dashboard. The core business problem was the lack of visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sold Room Nights (DSRN), Occupancy %, Realization %, and Revenue, which hindered data-driven decisions on pricing and operational strategy.

ü™ôScope:

‚Ä¢	Integrated data from 5 distinct CSV sources‚Äîincluding dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings‚Äîencompassing over 1 million records from multiple cities and booking platforms for the months of May, June, and July.

‚Ä¢	Performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, including duplicate handling, null value processing, and column renaming for consistency.

‚Ä¢	Built a robust star schema data model in Power BI to support efficient querying, cross-filtering, and drill-down analysis.

‚Ä¢	Developed interactive dashboards and dynamic DAX measures for real-time analysis of revenue trends, occupancy metrics, booking behavior, and property-level performance.

üìäGoals:

‚Ä¢	Provide hotel managers with clear, actionable insights into revenue performance, booking trends, and occupancy drivers.

‚Ä¢	Support dynamic pricing strategies to increase occupancy during low-demand periods and optimize revenue across room types and booking platforms.

‚Ä¢	Identify and resolve operational issues such as high no-show and cancellation rates to maximize revenue realization.

‚Ä¢	Empower stakeholders with a week-over-week and month-over-month performance view to facilitate timely, data-driven decision-making.

üìàKey Deliverables and Quantifiable Achievements:

‚Ä¢	Delivered a Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations, enabling property managers to monitor RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Occupancy %, Realization %, and revenue across multiple properties and platforms.

‚Ä¢	Built dynamic DAX measures to track week-over-week and month-over-month changes, supporting trend analysis and forecasting.

‚Ä¢	Implemented dynamic pricing strategies that achieved a 10-15% increase in occupancy rates during off-peak periods and a 5% revenue uplift overall.

‚Ä¢	Conducted channel-level pricing analysis using Pareto principles to prioritize high-performing platforms, resulting in a customer rating improvement to an average of 4.2/5.

‚Ä¢	Enabled property-level performance diagnostics that guided corrective actions at underperforming hotels, improving overall operational efficiency.
