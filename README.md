Project Overview

📊Led end-to-end development of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing hotel performance metrics using a dataset of 5 tables totaling over 1 million records, including revenue, occupancy, room type, and customer booking data across multiple cities and platforms.

📈Conducted extensive data modeling by creating star schema relationships among dimension and fact tables (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings) to ensure efficient querying and accurate cross-filtering.

💻Transformed raw data using Power Query, including duplicate query creation, header promotion, null handling, and column renaming, significantly improving data quality and ensuring clean, analysis-ready data.

💲Designed and implemented key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Occupancy %, Realization %, and Booking trends, enabling property-level and city-level performance tracking.

🏩Developed dynamic DAX measures to calculate week-over-week and month-over-month changes, enabling actionable insights on occupancy and revenue patterns (e.g. +5% occupancy on weekends vs. weekdays).

📈Created visualizations for executive dashboards, including trend analysis by week, occupancy by day type, booking percentage by platform, and property-level performance segmentation—enhancing decision-making for dynamic pricing strategies and revenue optimization.

🛗Collaborated closely with business managers to define and refine problem statements, gather requirements, and conduct iterative reviews, leading to improved stakeholder egagement and adoption of dynamic pricing models tailored to weekday/weekend demand.

💲Drove data-driven decisions that resulted in the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies, leading to an estimated 10-15% increase in occupancy rates during off-peak periods and 5% revenue uplift on average.

✅Utilized insights from channel-level pricing analyses to optimize marketing spend, focusing on high-performing booking platforms and city-specific promotions, contributing to improved customer satisfaction ratings (average rating increased to 4.2/5).

Title: Hotel Revenue Performance Analysis & Dashboard Development Using Power BI

📅Purpose and Business Problem:

The project aimed to solve the challenge of fragmented revenue and occupancy data across multiple hotels by building a unified, interactive Power BI dashboard. The core business problem was the lack of visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sold Room Nights (DSRN), Occupancy %, Realization %, and Revenue, which hindered data-driven decisions on pricing and operational strategy.

🪙Scope:

•	Integrated data from 5 distinct CSV sources—including dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings—encompassing over 1 million records from multiple cities and booking platforms for the months of May, June, and July.

•	Performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, including duplicate handling, null value processing, and column renaming for consistency.

•	Built a robust star schema data model in Power BI to support efficient querying, cross-filtering, and drill-down analysis.

•	Developed interactive dashboards and dynamic DAX measures for real-time analysis of revenue trends, occupancy metrics, booking behavior, and property-level performance.

📊Goals:

•	Provide hotel managers with clear, actionable insights into revenue performance, booking trends, and occupancy drivers.

•	Support dynamic pricing strategies to increase occupancy during low-demand periods and optimize revenue across room types and booking platforms.

•	Identify and resolve operational issues such as high no-show and cancellation rates to maximize revenue realization.

•	Empower stakeholders with a week-over-week and month-over-month performance view to facilitate timely, data-driven decision-making.

📈Key Deliverables and Quantifiable Achievements:

•	Delivered a Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations, enabling property managers to monitor RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Occupancy %, Realization %, and revenue across multiple properties and platforms.

•	Built dynamic DAX measures to track week-over-week and month-over-month changes, supporting trend analysis and forecasting.

•	Implemented dynamic pricing strategies that achieved a 10-15% increase in occupancy rates during off-peak periods and a 5% revenue uplift overall.

•	Conducted channel-level pricing analysis using Pareto principles to prioritize high-performing platforms, resulting in a customer rating improvement to an average of 4.2/5.

•	Enabled property-level performance diagnostics that guided corrective actions at underperforming hotels, improving overall operational efficiency.

⚙️Tools and Technologies:

•	Power BI (Dashboard Development, Data Modeling, Visualization)

•	DAX (Dynamic Measures, KPI Calculations)

•	Power Query (Data Transformation, Cleaning, Integration)

•	Excel (Data Analysis, Initial Exploration)

•	SQL (Data Integration Concepts, Analysis)
